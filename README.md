# puppet-xcode_tools

This Puppet module will install the current version of the Xcode CLI Tools for the version of macOS it is running on. It supports all versions of macOS from 10.9 upwards. It accepts no options, and uses Apple's Software Update to install the tools.

This module is based almost entirely on the [work of Tim Sutton](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/master/scripts/xcode-cli-tools.sh)
